# loveland-matrix

This is a single class program that "Given an arbitrary sized matrix (MxN), 
will zero out the entire row and column of any element that is '0'".

The static class is found in the zeroMatrix.js file along with some basic unit tests.

This code can be copied into any code editor then run.

--Process--
* Based on the directions I assumed that the matrix would be populated with ints.
* After writing out some test cases on paper I created the test runner and the different test cases.
* Then I went back to the zeroMatrix function and included all of the functionally needed to pass all of the tests.
